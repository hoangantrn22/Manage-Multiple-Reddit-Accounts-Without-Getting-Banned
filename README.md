## Why You Canâ€™t Create Many Reddit Accounts and Why You Get Banned

While Reddit allows multiple accounts, managing several accounts from the same device or IP address can easily trigger its anti-bot and spam filters. Here's why you might get banned:

1. **Vote Manipulation**: Using multiple accounts to upvote your own content or coordinate votes is strictly against Redditâ€™s rules. Any sign of vote manipulation, even if itâ€™s not intentional, can result in bans.
2. **Spamming or Coordinated Behavior**: Reddit bans accounts that participate in spammy behavior or engage in coordinated activities, such as posting the same content across multiple accounts or subreddits.
3. **IP Address Tracking**: Reddit tracks account activity via your IP address and cookies. If multiple accounts are being accessed from the same IP, Redditâ€™s systems will flag them as suspicious, which can lead to bans.

By using a rotating proxy, you can mask your real IP address, making each account appear as though itâ€™s being managed from a different user or location.

## How to Create More Accounts and Avoid Being Banned

Follow these best practices to safely manage multiple Reddit accounts without running into issues:

1. **Separate the Purpose of Each Account**: Ensure that each account serves a different purpose:

   * **Personal Account**: For personal discussions or niche interests.
   * **Business Account**: For work-related posts or marketing purposes.
   * **Moderation Account**: For managing subreddits.
2. **Avoid Coordinated Activities**: Keep your accounts independent. Donâ€™t cross-post the same content across different accounts or try to manipulate votes.
3. **Use Different Devices or Browsers**: Avoid using the same device or browser for all accounts. Different devices, browsers, or private/incognito modes reduce the chances of your accounts being linked together.
4. **Use a Proxy or VPN**: A rotating proxy, like **9Proxy**, is essential for ensuring that each account uses a different IP address, preventing Reddit from detecting them as connected.

## Why Using a Rotating Proxy and What Is It?

A **rotating proxy** is a tool that automatically changes your IP address at set intervals, making each of your Reddit accounts appear as if itâ€™s being managed by different users. This is key to avoiding detection by Redditâ€™s anti-bot systems.

* **Multiple IP Addresses**: A rotating proxy provides a pool of IP addresses, so each account can use a different IP, which makes it much harder for Reddit to track and link your accounts.
* **Anonymity and Security**: Using a rotating proxy ensures that your real IP address is never exposed, which keeps your accounts secure and anonymous.
* **Reduced Risk of Bans**: With a constantly changing IP address, your activity looks more organic and less suspicious to Redditâ€™s algorithms.

## Practical Guide with 9Proxy

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide on how to safely manage multiple Reddit accounts using **9Proxy**:

### Step 1: Login on the 9Proxy Website

* Go to the **[9Proxy website](https://9proxy.com)** and log into your account. If you donâ€™t have an account, sign up to get started.

### Step 2: Buy the Pack You Need

* Choose a **proxy plan** that suits your needs. 9Proxy offers different packages based on the number of proxies and bandwidth. Pick the plan that fits the scale of Reddit accounts you plan to manage.

### Step 3: Install the 9Proxy App and an Antidetect Browser

* Download and install the **9Proxy app** from their website.
* Install an **antidetect browser** (like **Multilogin**, **Ghost Browser**, or others) thatâ€™s compatible with 9Proxy. This will help you manage multiple accounts without leaving traces of your activity across accounts.

### Step 4: Log into Your Account in the 9Proxy App

* Open the **9Proxy app** and log in using your credentials. This allows you to configure your proxy settings and manage your rotating IP addresses.

### Step 5: Choose a Proxy You Want

* In the **9Proxy app**, select the proxy you wish to use. You can choose from different locations or specific IPs to match the geographical needs of your Reddit accounts.

### Step 6: Forward the Proxy to a Port and Copy Its Address

* **Forward the selected proxy to a port** within the app settings. This step will make the proxy accessible for use in your antidetect browser.
* **Copy the proxy address** and port number as you will need this information in the next step.

### Step 7: Set the Proxy Rotation Settings

* In the **9Proxy app**, go to the **settings** section and configure how frequently you want the proxy to rotate. You can set the rotation to happen after each request or after a set time interval. Rotating the proxy regularly ensures that your accounts appear to come from different users.

### Step 8: Set Up the Proxy in the Antidetect Browser

* Open your **antidetect browser** (e.g., **Multilogin** or **Ghost Browser**).
* Go to the **proxy settings** and fill in the **proxy address** and **port number** you copied from the 9Proxy app.
* This will connect your antidetect browser to the rotating proxy, ensuring that each Reddit account gets a different IP address.

### Step 9: Start Creating Your Accounts

* With the proxy set up, you can now start creating multiple Reddit accounts. For each account, use a different proxy and browser session to keep them distinct.
* Be sure to follow Redditâ€™s guidelines and avoid cross-posting identical content across accounts. Engage authentically in different communities to make each account look like a real, independent user.
